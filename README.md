# Programming Resources

## Introduction

This repository originally started off as a collection of resources and advice gathered from myself and others during my time at Lambda School (now called [Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/)). While sending out LinkedIn invites to people I looked up to, I decided to start asking people what tips they had for a new student. What I found was an amazingly gifted group of individuals that opened their minds up to help me learn from their successes and mistakes.

I decided to compile all of this advice along with great tech resources (for job prep, interviews, and more) into a single place and pass it on to future learners and builders so that you can benefit from it as well. Every single person quoted in this document has given me their express permission to do so. Every single one of them remembers what it was like to be in your shoes, and they want to give back to the community that theyâ€™ve come from. I hope their advice helps you in your journey and enables you to reach your goals.
